    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a refreshingly delicious vegetarian dish that can also be paired with something like salmon if you so choose. The roasted vegetables that are doused
        in oil and later sprinkled in lemon juice bring a ton of flavor. Add in pine nuts or walnuts for some extra texture and feta cheese and garlic to bring it
        all together.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 C Walnuts (or Pine Nuts)</li>
        <li>1 C Mix of Red, Yellow and Orange Bell Peppers (diced)</li>
        <li>1 lb Asparagus (cut into 1" pieces)</li>
        <li>12 0z Cherry Tomatoes (cut in half)</li>
        <li>2 tsp Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>5 tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 C Orzo</li>
        <li>1.5 C Vegetable Broth</li>
        <li>1/2 C Crumbled Feta</li>
        <li>1 tbs Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>2-3 tbs Chopped Fresh Basil (optional)</li>
        <li>2-3 tbs Chopped Fresh Parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F and toast walnuts for 6-7 minutes, or until toasty and fragrant. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Turn oven up to 425F. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper. Place the bell peppers, asparagus, tomatoes and garlic 
            on one pan. Sprinkle with 2 Tbs of olive oil. Using a spatula, mix all the veggies together with the olive oil. Sprinkle with 
            1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper then stir again. Move 1/2 the veggie mixture to the other sheet pan. Spread the veggies in one layer, 
            making sure there's no overlapping on both pans. Roast in a 400F oven for 20-30 minutes (due to oven variations, you may need to roast them longer;
            you ideally want to roast them until there is some good charring.) You may need to rotate the pans halfway through.</li>
        <li>In a large saute pan, heat 1 Tbs of Olive Oil on medium heat until shimmering. Add the orzo and stir, coating the orzo thoroughly. Stir occasionally 
            for about 3 minutes or until the orzo is toasty and golden. Add the vegetable broth. Be careful here because the broth will spit and sputter. Bring 
            to a simmer, turn down the heat to low, cover and cook for about 15 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed. Stir. Remove from heat, cover and 
            set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl add 2 tbs olive oil, the lemon juice, 1/2 tsp of salt, and 1/4 tsp of pepper. Whisk until all the ingredients are emulsified.</li>
        <li>In the large saute pan, to the orzo, add the roasted veggies and all their juices, stir in the dressing, feta, and walnuts. Garnish generously 
            with basil and parsley. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
